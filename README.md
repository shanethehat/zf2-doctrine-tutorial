ZF2 Doctrine Tutorial
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a learning exercise for me in using Doctrine ORM with Zend Framework 2. It uses Rob Allen's album tutorial and the ZF2 Skeleton as a base, and is built using Jason Grimes's blog post as a heavy inspiration.


Installation
------------

To install this project, you should clone it out to your local machine and invoke `composer` using the shipped `composer.phar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    git clone git://github.com/shanethehat/zf2-doctrine-tutorial.git
    cd zf2-doctrine-tutorial
    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install

(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`
available.)


Virtual Host
------------
Afterwards, set up a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the project and you should be ready to go!
